## Dataset Introduction
We developed **ImperialDance**, which comprises 69,300 seconds of dance motions and music, **5 genres**, **20 pieces of music** and **20 choreographies** with dancers of **3 different expertise levels**.\
Two advantages of our dataset could be summarized as:\
(i) It is the first dataset that describes the expertise level differences of dancing, which promotes the research on dacning skill assessment. \
(ii) Compared to other dance-music datasets that only provide one sample of the dance motion per choreography, we provide 100 repeating samples for each class (per music, per genre, per choreography and expertise level). This will benefit the feature learning of particular dance motions and level progression modeling.
